# just-play
Just Play! is a social media application for musicians to share their interests and interact with each other.

This is an app using Redux, YouTube API, and a web crawler.

Comments folder contains actions and reducer for comments in the application. Components folder contains all components related to videos and comments functionality. UI folder contains images that display the application's appearance or presentation.

For this project, I used a bootstrap template and adapted it according to the application's needs.
